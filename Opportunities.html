        <p>AI is amazing. It has so much potential that it brings many opportunities to society that can access both now and further in the future as technology advances. Currently in China it is utilising AI in a questionably ethical way, domestic control. It is used in many things such as surveillance, crime prediction, speech recognition but also autonomous missiles and internet censorship (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). Many of these opportunities, however, are not just in China and are found in many other Leading AI countries. AI systems have also been used for many other opportunities such as, fraud prevention, risk management, financial decisions (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). Elon Musk, CEO of tesla and world’s richest man has also begun many AI start-ups including one company that is trying to create a smart device that can be implemented into the brain to help with many issues such as helping amputees gain proper functionality of prosthetic limbs. Tesla is also the leading brand of self-driving cars that work through AI.
            Whether it’s finding patterns in chemical reactions that lead to new drugs being formed or helping lawyers find the most appropriate strategies to pursue a case, there are many ways in which AI can enhance the capabilities of most individuals. AI systems and humans have many strengths, that when combined, can accomplish more than what they thought they could achieve. An AI system might be better at collecting available data and making decisions in characterized parts of a problem, while a human may be better at understanding the consequences of the data (Ronald. M Baecker), working with difficult objectives, and identifying actions that are far beyond what AI might be programmed to figure out. 
            AI can help with the discovery of new things. While humans can always analyze a piece of AI from the outside, new developments in AI and visualization of AI are making it easier for humans to analyse a piece of AI programs more thoroughly and use them to manage information in a way that helps a human expert put the pieces together and making insights. For example, analysis of how an AI system internally organises words can help us understand and visualize the way words are like “awful” and undergo changes over a period of time.
