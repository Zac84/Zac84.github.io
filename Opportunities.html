        <p>AI is amazing. It has so much potential that it brings many opportunities to society that can access both now and further in the future as technology advances. Currently in China it is utilising AI in a questionably ethical way, domestic control. It is used in many things such as surveillance, crime prediction, speech recognition but also autonomous missiles and internet censorship (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). Many of these opportunities, however, are not just in China and are found in many other Leading AI countries. AI systems have also been used for many other opportunities such as, fraud prevention, risk management, financial decisions (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). Elon Musk, CEO of tesla and worldâ€™s richest man has also begun many AI start-ups including one company that is trying to create a smart device that can be implemented into the brain to help with many issues such as helping amputees gain proper functionality of prosthetic limbs. Tesla is also the leading brand of self-driving cars that work through AI.
