        <p> We have a few choices when it comes to adopting AI. The first option is slowly integrating it into society like are currently doing, in smart phones with Siri or google assistant, In self driving cars like Tesla, In aiding with medical research, and even in things like image processing. AI is helping us in the areas and some of us may not even know it, this means that it doesn’t raise many issues or controversy around the topic as things are being taken quite slowly and lowkey. On the other hand, society is going to have the option to integrate AI into our society faster and faster, currently there are people working on a brain implant that can give us a brain-machine interface. This way may be more beneficial but also doesn’t come without its risks and doubts and it would raise many issues Involving privacy, legal, safety and ethical issues.  </p>
