        <p>Personally, I am a prominent advocate for AI. This is because I believe that with the right people behind it, AI will take us into a new age faster than anything else. Getting there, though, will not be without its challenges. There are many ethical challenges and issues that we will face as AI advances. One of the most significant issues is job security. This is because as AI advances it is not a question about if AI will replace many of our jobs, but how quickly and how many. This raises many ethical issues, as, without available jobs, people cannot make money. This means that people who support their families or those in lower economic brackets may not be able to afford basic living requirements like food and shelter. Another ethical issue that arises as AI advances is AI not being used for good. This is already happening in places like China, where it is being used for internet censorship, extreme surveillance, and autonomous missiles. As it is already happening, it raises questions about what potential issues could be caused on a larger scale in the future that could potentially cause lead to a significant loss of life. Although it does have ethical issues, these can be avoided if AI is developed carefully, which can lead to outstanding achievements and extremely helpful tools such as aiding in medical research.</p>
