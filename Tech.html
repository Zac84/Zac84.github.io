        <p> AI or artificial intelligence is essentially a computer trying to simulate human intelligence. It does this by taking in large 
            amounts of data and by using iterative processing algorithms it learns patterns and features. We chose AI because of its increasing relevance 
            more and more every day. It’s in the cars that we drive and the phones in our pocket and its not going anywhere. In fact, even though the US has 
            a relatively small AI departments many countries such as China, Canada and even large companies such as uber are investing between 100’s of millions
             of dollars and even billion (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). It’s also very interesting because of its potential, in both bad ways like the movie 
             terminator but also its unlimited potential to do good. </p>
