        <p> AI is not all good though, as such it still comes with many risks. An example of a risk could be self-driving cars for example. Take Tesla, the cars own manual states that cars algorithms are not perfect, and car be misled by abnormally bright sunlight or bad road markings (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). This can be revealed by looking at Tesla statistics, in 2018 there were 2 fatalities caused by self-driving tesla’s due to insufficient training of the AI. “Those who are in or near to self-driving vehicles are human guinea pigs while vendors tackle the huge problems that remain.” – (Ronald M. Baecker, 2019). Psychology professor (and one-time director of Uber AI Research) Gary Marcus stated, “todays deep learning algorithms are greedy, brittle, opaque, and shallow”. This is because they take a large amount of data, break very easily, they make very hard to understand decisions and lack common sense. This brings me onto the next risk, an AI does not have emotions, this means that when it comes to ethical decisions it becomes very complicated. Another risk with AI is that because so many things rely on it, such as assisting with financial decisions, if someone were to maliciously change the results intentionally, it could cause big problem. Another big risk is that society are very scared that in the future in when AI becomes very advanced, it may become like the popular movie Terminator. Now this is not going to happen, but it does cause a distaste for many people which can lead to problems down the line.
